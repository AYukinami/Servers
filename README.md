# Final Fantasy XI Private Server Community

Welcome! This repository is home to the Final Fantasy XI private server community. This repository serves to hold information regarding all things private servers for FFXI. You will find information regarding the available private servers you can play on, additional information about our community, information about the available server core to build and host your own server, and more.

# Available Private Servers

The private server community for FFXI is full of various servers available for anyone to play on. Each server has its own vision and goals in regards to how the server is setup, configured, and what contain is made available. Some servers strive to replicate original retail eras of the game (ie. old school CoP, Treasures, etc.) while others aim to provide a customized expeience with their own custom content, modifications to existing content and more.

**You can find a list of available servers here: [Server List](SERVERS.md)**

_**Note:** To help declutter the main server list page, the list is generalized to key aspects about each server. For much more detailed information about each server, be sure to check the servers individually linked custom advertisement page. These individual pages hold much more detail about the server, its various configurations (ie. rates) and available content._

# Further Discussions

Our community has two primary means of communication and discussions; Discord and Reddit

## 1. Reddit

Our subreddit has been the original means of advertisement and open discussions about private servers. Over the last few years, we have narrowed down the goals and objectives of the sub to be more focused on a few key things.

  - Server Advertisements
  - Server Reviews / Feedback
  - General Discussions

First and foremost, the sub has been used as a means for server owners to advertise their servers and post about major updates/patches. Following this, we have greatly encouraged the general players to also leave feedback posts and reviews about the servers they play on. This allows others to get a feel about each server, its staff, and playerbase before making any kind of commitment to playing somewhere.

General discussions about individual server topics have been encouraged to instead take place on our newer Discord server. _We currently avoid generalized discussions about servers on the sub to prevent a single server from dominating the subs front page with multiple topics. This tends to happen anytime a new server pops up and multiple new players want to discuss various aspects about the server and make a dozen different topics. Instead, users are encouraged to use our Discord instead._

You can find the subreddit here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIPrivateServers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIPrivateServers/)

## 2. Discord

Our Discord server is also used for multiple purposes such as:

  - Server Advertisements
  - Server Discussions / Feedback
  - Developer Discussions
  - Server Owner Moderation Chats / Information Sharing

Each server that wishes to be listed is welcome to having a channel dedicated to their server on the Discord. We have each server listed within categories based on the servers level cap and content scope. _(ie. Custom or Retail-Lke)_

Players are also encouraged to hold open discussions about their preferred server within these channels, be it feedback, overal reviews of the server, discussions of the servers features/content, and so on.

We also house developer discussions for private server developers / server administrators to discuss work on their own individual servers as well as discussions related to the main server core project all servers are forked from. _(**Please note:** While we do host these channels for open developer discussions, they are **NOT** intended to be the means of communication for bug reports, or other similar discussions related to the server core itself. Those types of discussions and reports belong on the server core repo/issue tracker/discussions pages. See the server core information below for links.)_

Once servers have gained a 'trusted' status of being active and part of the community for a period of time, staff of each server is added to a set of moderation channels that allows staff of all servers to privately communicate with each other in regards to administrative topics and issues. Such as player warnings/bans of problem players, exploit discoveries and warnings, assistance with server operations and more.

# Final Fantasy Private Server Core Project

The current in-development server core for Final Fantasy XI private servers is: [LandSandBoat](https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server)

**Please note:** The Final Fantasy Private Server Community operates separate from the server core project. While our communities are separate, our goals are similar. Because of this, we ask that you make use of the appropriate channels when working with the server core software / source code. While our Discord does hold discussion channels for developers, you should still report bugs/issues directly to the LandSandBoat issue tracker.
