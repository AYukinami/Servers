# Guidelines - New Server Listings

Firstly, hello and welcome to our community! In order to have your server added to the official listings here, we do ask that you ensure your server meets the following set of requirements first.

  - Your server should have a website and/or a Discord server. _(Players need to be able to contact you for support related to your server.)_
  - Your server should be online and active for at least `1 month` before applying.
  - Your server should have active players, besides yourself/your staff, before applying.
  - Your server must be online 24/7. _(Downtime for things like maintenance, crashes, weather events, etc. are fine. But, it should not be offline otherwise. Servers listed here are expected to be ran on dedicated hardware.)_
  - Your server should have set goals/objectives. _(Servers listed here are expected to have purpose. This is not a place to list your sandbox/development server that will be wiped every other week.)_

If you feel your server meets the above requirements and wish to have it added to the listings, please open a new issue using the `New Server Listing` template. _Applications must be filled out fully, otherwise your server will be rejected!_

> [!NOTE]
> These requirements are not designed to deter new servers from starting or succeeding. Instead, they are designed to prevent a large influx of newcomers from spamming to have their server added to the list who will not stick around for the long haul. In most cases, new servers rarely last the first few months. This generally happens because the owner(s) joined the community without understanding there is actual work involved in running a successful server and that just compiling the code does not get what they wanted immediately. Because of this, we ask that people prove they plan to stick around and put in the effort of running their server before we will add it to our lists.

# Guidelines - Updating Existing Listings

Owners are encouraged to keep their server listing information up to date. This includes both your servers information on the main [Server List](SERVERS.md) page, as well as your servers individual advertisement page in the respective `/servers/` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> Pull requests made to make changes to a servers information **MUST** be submitted by the servers owner. Submissions from non-owners will be rejected. This is to prevent spam editing listings for malicious intent or attempting to provide invalid information.

Server advertisement pages are intended to be customized by the owner to look unique and provide the best information for your server. We encourage you to style it as you wish, including the use of images, have detailed information (lists, tables, etc.), and be creative. However, in doing so, we also ask that you follow the guidelines listed here to avoid having your listing modified by staff.

If you plan to use images in your listing, then we ask that you follow these guidelines:

  - Images should be hosted either on your servers personal website or on imgur. _(Please do not upload images)_
  - Images should be appropriate in relation to the game. _(No sensitive content, 18+ material, etc. Keep it clean.)_
  - Images should not contain any hateful or hurtful content.
  - Images should not contain anything in relation towards another server. _(ie. Saying you are better than XYZ server.)_

## Expected Listing Contents

Listings must at least contain the following information:

  - A link to your servers website.
  - A link to your servers Discord server. _(If your server does not use Discord, then a link to the proper means of communication to contact your servers staff.)_

Listings should contain the following information:

  - Detailed information about your server.
  - Level Cap
  - Content Style _(ie. Retail-Like, Custom, etc.)_
  - Available Expansions _(ie. CoP, Treasures, Wings, etc.)_
  - Available Jobs
  - Available Content _(ie. BCNMs, Dynamis, Nyzul, Salvage, FoV / GoV, etc.)_
  - Available Activities _(ie. HELM, Digging, Fishing, etc.)_
  - Movement Speed _(ie. In comparison to retail, or the actual setting value.)_
  - Rates _(Crafting, Exp, Skillups, etc.)_
  - Level Sync Availability _(ie. Is it enabled? What kind of restrictions if so, etc.)_
  - Trusts Availability _(ie. Are they enabled? What kind of restrictions if so, etc.)_
  - Any additional information about your server. _(The more detailed the better, make players excited!)_

Listings should also contain proper detailed information in regards to your servers installation requirements. If your server requires a specific installation of the game client _(ie. if your server is version locked)_ then your listing should disclose this. It should link to full installation details on how the player should get onto your server successfully.

## Listing Rules

Firstly, your listing **MUST** follow our community rules/guidelines found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIPrivateServers/wiki/rules

Along with this, your server listing **SHOULD NOT** include any of the following:

  - Any kind of advertisement for money related purposes. _(ie. Donations, Donation Perks, Patreon, etc.)_
  - Any kind of advertisement style links. _(ie. Adfly, Bitly, Paypal, Sponsorship Links, etc.)_
  - Any kind of harmful content or links.
  - Any kind of drama, bickering, trolling, or similar kind of content.
  - Any kind of drama, insults, or other content towards another server. _(You should not mention any other servers in your listing.)_
  - Misleading information to attract players with false pretenses. _(ie. Fake player counts, inflated population growth, etc.)_

> [!NOTE]
> These guidelines are subject to change, at any time, without any notice. We reserve the right to alter any server listing as we see fit to adhere to these guidelines or any future changes made to them.
