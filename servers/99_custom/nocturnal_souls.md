## Our Mission
**You are the chosen adventures that will save the world! You should act like it!**

Nocturnal Souls is designed to be a **fun server** where playing solo, duo, and in small groups allows you to take on the challenges that heroes should: **incredibly tough mobs and an epic story**.  We see Vana'diel as the world to tell our own stories, focusing on custom questlines and stories rather than attempting to recreate the past.

The Nocturnal Souls server aims to increase the speed of solo and small group gameplay while keeping it fun and exciting. We allow you to easily move about the world, explore, and find adventures. Unlike retail or the "old days", you'll be keeping your weapon skills going and constantly casting spells, **not** sitting around waiting for the next auto attack swing or sitting on the sidelines waiting for your MP to tick.  You'll also be hitting those big numbers--because what hero _doesn't_ like big crits? :grin:

Speed and progression follow more along the speed of the nation and expansion missions rather than sitting in a zone mindlessly murdering small woodland creatures for hours on end to gain levels. Adventurers should feel empowered to push the limit against very tough and incredibly tough mobs. The grind is _mostly_ gone allowing you to log in, chat with friends, save the day, and craft up a tasty mithakabob at our relaxing hangout.
