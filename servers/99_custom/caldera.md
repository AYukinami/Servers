# Server Information

Caldera is a 99+ server with custom content & the goal of providing endgame content to 6-player parties, challenging fights which focus on skill & teamwork.

All jobsâ€™ functionality (including GEO and RUN) were prioritized and continue to undergo evaluation for improvements and balance.

Progression through level 99 to item level 119 has been the primary focus of development and is now moving into 119+ content and gear. The server aims to get players into this progression phase quickly, and focus on the endgame content available.
